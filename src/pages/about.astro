            I'm Ashwin Philips — a systems architect, AI researcher, and music producer
            fascinated by the emergence of intelligence from distributed systems.
          </p>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-400 leading-relaxed">
            My work spans from building production infrastructure at scale to exploring
            the theoretical foundations of consciousness. I believe the future of intelligence
            is collaborative, distributed, and fundamentally emergent.

            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              Every system I build is designed with a unified purpose. Not rigid uniformity,
              but organic harmony where each component serves the whole. From code architecture
              to system design to musical composition — coherence is the guiding principle.

            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              I approach problems by decomposing them to their fundamental components.
              Understanding the deep structure of a system enables building solutions that
              are elegant, scalable, and resilient.

            <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
              The most interesting properties of systems aren't programmed — they emerge
              from the interactions of simpler components. I design systems that create
              the conditions for intelligence to arise naturally.

  <!-- Journey -->

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-12 text-center">The Journey</h2>

        <div class="space-y-8 text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            I started my career at IBM, developing compilers and leading QA automation
            teams. That early exposure to low-level systems thinking shaped how I approach
            problems — always understanding what's happening beneath the abstractions.
          </p>

          <p>
            After IBM, I founded SoBe Tech Guru, providing data recovery and IT services.
            Working directly with clients taught me the importance of trust, reliability,
            and clear communication — principles I carry into every project.
          </p>

          <p>
            In 2015, I founded Emergent Solutions to explore a question that had been
            growing in my mind: <strong class="text-section-primary">How does intelligence emerge from
            distributed systems?</strong>
          </p>

          <p>
            That question led me deep into AI research, consciousness studies, and
            distributed systems architecture. Along the way, I've built production systems
            serving millions of requests, conducted original research into abstract reasoning,
            and developed frameworks for autonomous agent coordination.
          </p>

          <p>
            Music has been a constant throughout. Composition and production offer a different
            lens on the same questions — how do individual elements combine to create
            something greater than their sum? The same principles that guide my technical
            work apply to creating immersive sonic experiences.
          </p>

          <p class="text-lg text-accent">
            Today, my work integrates all these threads: building systems that are technically
            excellent, theoretically grounded, and fundamentally aimed at enabling new forms
            of intelligence to emerge.
